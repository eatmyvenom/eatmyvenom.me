# Welcome to my site

Here I plan on keeping most of my stuff that I want to host publically. I have put pacman repo here on http://eatmyvenom.me/pkgs. You can use this if you would like but it is not very fast for downloads.

## What do I do
I am basically just a Linux enthusiest, Minecraft player, and Discord bot developer the the moment. My main project at the moment is [HyArcade](https://hyarcade.xyz)
